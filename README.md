Drives fatigue is a significant factor contributing to road accidents worldwide. It may be produced by sleep disorders, certain types of medication and even boredom because of driving for an extended period. Those in the prime of their lives are particularly vulnerable, with road injuries the leading cause of death among those 18-30 years old. The gole of this project is to develop a system that can accurately detect sleepy driving and make alarms accordingly, which airms to prevent the drives from drowsy driving and create a safer driving environment.
